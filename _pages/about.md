I'm a fourth-year PhD student at the [University of Amsterdam ](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/about/) and [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I have been very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and [Prof. Zhaochun Ren](https://renzhaochun.github.io/). 

My current research areas include large language model (LLM) alignment and  LLM-based agents for critical decision-making (legal, medical and finance tasks).
