I'm a recent graduate from the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), where I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Technique. I have been very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhaochun Ren](https://renzhaochun.github.io/) from the [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en). 

My current research areas include Recommender Systems and Natural Language Processing.

 **I am actively looking forward to pursuing a PhD position for Fall 2025 to further my research!** Please see my CV for more details. Feel free to contact me if you’re interested!
