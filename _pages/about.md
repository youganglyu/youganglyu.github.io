**Xiaoyu Zhang**  
I'm a recent graduate from the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), where I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Technique. My research interests lie in recommender systems, natural language processing, and large language models.

I have been very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhaochun Ren](https://renzhaochun.github.io/) from the [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en). I am actively looking forward to pursuing a PhD position to further my research in these fields. 

You can find my CV here: [Xiaoyu Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/XiaoyuZhang_CV.pdf).
